# Star Wars FFG Character Generator

## Description

Creating characters in the Star Wars RPG series on Linux hasn't been easy. 
While there's a great character generator by OggDude, it's mostly for Windows users. 
This project is about making character creation smooth for Linux fans too. 
Even though OggDude's tool is awesome, this effort is to give Linux users their own character generator. 
Feel free to explore OggDude's work https://www.swrpgcommunity.com/gm-resources/apps-dice-utilities/oggdudes-generator
